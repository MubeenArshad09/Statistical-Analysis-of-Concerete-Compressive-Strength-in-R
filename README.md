# Statistical-Analysis-of-Concerete-Compressive-Strength-in-R
Performed exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and hypothesis testing on concrete compressive strength data using R.


## Statistical Analysis of Concrete Strength

This task explores the relationship between various concrete components and compressive strength using the "Concrete Compressive Strength" dataset. A series of regression models and statistical tests were used to draw conclusions.

### Key Methods:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation and pair plot analysis
- Multi-linear regression (MLR)
- Regression assumption testing (linearity, multicollinearity, residual normality, etc.)
- Hypothesis testing using t-tests and Chi-Square

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- R
- RStudio
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `forecast`, `TTR`, `tseries`, `car`, etc.

## 📁 Files
-  R script for statistical analysis of concrete strength
- `datasets/`: Contains the input CSV files used in both tasks
